## Everything we need to know about HTTP

- HTTP is the protocol that every web developer should know, as it powers the entire web.
- Knowing HTTP can certainly help us develop better applications.
- In this article, We will discuss **what HTTP is**, **how it came to be**, **where it stands today**, and how we got here.

### What is HTTP?

- HTTP is a **TCP/IP-based application layer communication protocol that standardizes how clients and servers communicate with each other**. - It defines how content is requested and transmitted across the internet.
- By application layer protocol, I mean that itâ€™s simply an abstraction layer that **standardizes how hosts (clients and servers) communicate**.
- HTTP itself depends on TCP/IP to get requests and responses between the client and server.
- By default, **TCP port 80** is used, but other ports can also be used.
- HTTPS, however, uses **port 443**.
