## Everything we need to know about HTTP

- HTTP is the protocol that every web developer should know, as it powers the entire web.
- Knowing HTTP can certainly help us develop better applications.
- In this article, We will discuss **what HTTP is**, **how it came to be**, **where it stands today**, and how we got here.

### What is HTTP?

- HTTP is a **TCP/IP-based application layer communication protocol that standardizes how clients and servers communicate with each other**. - It defines how content is requested and transmitted across the internet.
- By application layer protocol, I mean that itâ€™s simply an abstraction layer that **standardizes how hosts (clients and servers) communicate**.
- HTTP itself depends on TCP/IP to get requests and responses between the client and server.
- By default, **TCP port 80** is used, but other ports can also be used.
- HTTPS, however, uses **port 443**.

### HTTP/0.9 - The One Liner (1991)

- The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP/0.9 which was put forward in 1991.
- It was the simplest protocol ever; **having a single method called GET**.
- If a client had to access some webpage on the server, it would have made the simple request like below:
  `GET /index.html`
  And the response from server would have looked as follows:

```
  (response body)
  (connection closed)
```

- That is, the server would get the request, reply with the HTML in response and as soon as the content has been transferred, the connection will be closed. There were:
  - No headers
  - `GET` was the only allowed method
  - Response had to be HTML
- As you can see, the protocol really had nothing more than being a stepping stone for what was to come.
