## A. Introduction to the Internet

- First, we need to understand **what a Network is**
- A Network is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other
- All of these **networks when connected together form the internet**
- The internet is **network of networks**, developed in the late **1960**'s by **US Department of Defense** as means of creating a **decentralized communication network** that could withstand a nuclear attack

## B. How the Internet Works: An Overview

- At a high level, internet works by **connecting devices and computer systems** together using a **set of standardized protocols**
- **These protocols define how information is exchanged** between devices and ensure that data is **transmitted reliably and securely**
- **The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers**, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems
- When we send **data over the internet**, it's **broken up into small packets** that are sent from your device to a router
- **The router examines the packet** and **forward it to the next router** in the path towards its destination.
- This process continues **untill the packet reaches its final destination**
- To ensure the packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **IP is responsible for routing packets** to their correct destination, while **TCP ensure that packets** are transmitted reliably and in the correct order
- In addition to these core protocols, there are other protocols such as **DNS** (Domain Name System), **HTTP** (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), **SSL** / **TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security).
