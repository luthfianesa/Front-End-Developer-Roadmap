## A. Introduction to the Internet

- First, we need to understand **what a Network is**
- A Network is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other
- All of these **networks when connected together form the internet**
- The internet is **network of networks**, developed in the late **1960**'s by **US Department of Defense** as means of creating a **decentralized communication network** that could withstand a nuclear attack

## B. How the Internet Works: An Overview

- At a high level, internet works by **connecting devices and computer systems** together using a **set of standardized protocols**
- **These protocols define how information is exchanged** between devices and ensure that data is **transmitted reliably and securely**
- **The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers**, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems
- When we send **data over the internet**, it's **broken up into small packets** that are sent from your device to a router
- **The router examines the packet** and **forward it to the next router** in the path towards its destination.
- This process continues **untill the packet reaches its final destination**
- To ensure the packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **IP is responsible for routing packets** to their correct destination, while **TCP ensure that packets** are transmitted reliably and in the correct order
- In addition to these core protocols, there are other protocols such as **DNS** (Domain Name System), **HTTP** (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), **SSL** / **TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security).

## C. Basic Concepts and Terminology

- **Packet** : A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet
- **Router** : A device that directs packets of data between different networks
- **IP Address** : A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination
- **Domain Name** : A human-readable name that is used to identify a website such as google.com
- **DNS** : The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses
- **HTTP** : The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website)
- **HTTPS** : An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server
- **SSL / TLS** : The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet

## D. The Role of Protocols in Internet

- Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet.
- A protocol is a **set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems**.
- There are many different protocols used in internet communication, including the Internet Protocol (**IP**), the Transmission Control Protocol (**TCP**), the User Datagram Protocol (**UDP**), the Domain Name System (**DNS**), and many others.
- IP is responsible for **routing packets of data to their correct destination**.
- TCP and UDP **ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and efficiently**.
- DNS is used to **translate domain names into IP addresses**.
- HTTP is used to **transfer data between clients and servers**.
- One of the key benefits of using **standardized protocols** is that they **allow devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate with each other seamlessly**.
- For example, a web browser developed by one company can communicate with a web server developed by another company, as long as they both adhere to the HTTP protocol.
- As a developer, it’s **important to understand the various protocols used in internet communication** and how they work together to enable the transfer of data and information over the internet.

## E. Understanding IP Adresses and Domain Names

- IP addresses and domain names are both important concepts to understand when working with the internet.
- An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.
- It’s used to **route data to the correct destination**, ensuring that information is sent to the intended recipient.
- IP addresses are typically represented as a series of **four numbers separated by periods**, such as “**192.168.1.1**”.
- Domain names, on the other hand, are **human-readable names** used to identify websites and other internet resources.
- They’re typically composed of two or more parts, separated by periods.
- For example, “google.com” is a domain name.
- **Domain names are translated into IP addresses** using the Domain Name System (DNS).
- DNS is a critical part of the internet infrastructure, responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
- When you enter a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP address.
- Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the website or other resource you’ve requested.

## F. Introduction to HTTP and HTTPS

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are **two of the most commonly used protocols in internet-based applications and services**.
- HTTP is the **protocol used to transfer data between a client** (such as a web browser) **and a server** (such as a website).
- When you visit a website, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or other resource you’ve requested. - The server then sends an HTTP response back to the client, containing the requested data.
- **HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP**, which **encrypts the data being transmitted between the client and server using SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption.
- This provides an additional layer of security, helping to **protect sensitive information** such as **login credentials**, **payment information**, and **other personal data**.
- When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your web browser will display a **padlock icon in the address bar**, indicating that the connection is secure.
- You may also see the letters “https” at the beginning of the website address, rather than “http”.

## G. Building Applications with TCP / IP

- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the **underlying communication protocol used by most internet-based applications and services**.
- It provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices.
- When building applications with TCP/IP, there are a few key concepts to understand:
  - **Ports**: Ports are used to **identify the application or service running on a device**. Each application or service is assigned a unique port number, allowing data to be sent to the correct destination.
  - **Sockets**: A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication. Sockets are used to **establish connections between devices and transfer data between applications**.
  - **Connections**: A connection is **established between two sockets when two devices want to communicate with each other**. During the connection establishment process, the devices negotiate various parameters such as the maximum segment size and window size, which determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.
  - **Data transfer**: Once a connection is established, data can be transferred between the applications running on each device. **Data is typically transmitted in segments, with each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable delivery**.

<br>

- When building applications with TCP/IP, you’ll need to ensure that your application is designed to work with the appropriate ports, sockets, and connections.
- You’ll also need to be familiar with the various protocols and standards that are commonly used with TCP/IP, such as HTTP, **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol), and **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
- Understanding these concepts and protocols is essential for building effective, scalable, and secure internet-based applications and services.

## H. Securing Internet Communication with SSL / TLS

- As we discussed earlier, **SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data being transmitted over the internet**.
- It is commonly used to **provide secure connections for applications** such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs.
- When using SSL/TLS to secure internet communication, there are a few key concepts to understand:
  - **Certificates**: SSL/TLS certificates are used to **establish trust between the client and server**. They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority) to verify their authenticity.
  - **Handshake**: During the SSL/TLS handshake process, **the client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters** for the secure connection.
  - **Encryption**: Once the secure connection is established, **data is encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm** and can be transmitted securely between the client and server.
    <br>
- When building internet-based applications and services, it’s **important to understand how SSL/TLS works**
- To ensure that your application is designed to use SSL/TLS when transmitting sensitive data such as login credentials, payment information, and other personal data.
- You’ll also need to ensure that you obtain and maintain **valid SSL/TLS certificates** for your servers
- And that you follow best practices for configuring and securing your SSL/TLS connections.
- By doing so, you can help protect your users’ data and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your application’s communication over the internet.

## I. The Future: Emerging Trends and Technologies
